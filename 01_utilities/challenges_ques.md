1. Challenges Self-Intro Script Generator

Create a Python script that interacts with the user and generates a personalized self-introduction.
# Your Program should do the following:
    1. Ask the user for their name, age, city, profession, and favorite hooby.
    2. Format this data into a warm, friendly paragraph of self-introduction.
    3. Print the final paragraph in a clean and readable format.

## Example Output:
    # If the user inputs: -
        1. Name: kash
        2. Age: 29
        3. City: Jamshedpur
        4. Profession: Software Developer
        5. Hobby: Playing Guitar

### Your Script might output:
    "Hello! My name is Akash. I'm 29 years old and live in Jamshedpur. I work as a Software Developer and I absolutely enjoy playing guitar in my free time. Nice to meet you!"

#### Bonus:
    - Add the current date to the end of the paragraph like:
    "Logged on: 2025-09-17"
    - Wrap the printed message with a decorative border of stars (*).
